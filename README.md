# zMAP

The design of zMAP aims to simultaneously compare protein profiles of multiple samples and integrate samples from different MS runs for identifying hypervariable 
proteins across samples. zMAP models the mean-variance dependence associated with ILMS intensities and accordingly applies a variance-stabilizing z-transformation
(z-statistic), which dramatically increases the comparability between samples generated by different MS runs. The z-statistic can be widely applied in downstream 
analyses, including PCA, clustering analysis, GSVA, and so on. zMAP 
requires that all the involved MS runs are associated with the same biological design, such that the average intensities across all samples in each run are biologically identical.

# Installation
## from source code
The latest version release of `motifscanR` could install with:


```r
BiocManager::install('LouisKwok-PICB/motifscanR')
```

# Usage

`motifscanR` could be used for genomic regions motif enrichment analysis
with `motifScan` function. 
```r
library(motifscanR)
library(JASPAR2020)
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)

# Get a motif pwms
example_motifs <- getJasparMotifs(species = "Homo sapiens",
                                  collection = "CORE")

# Make a set of peaks
peaks <- GenomicRanges::GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1","chr2","chr2"),
                ranges = IRanges::IRanges(start = c(76585873,42772928,100183786),
                                          width = 500))

# Scan motif for example motifs
motif_ix <- motifScan(example_motifs, peaks, genome = "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
```
The input object of genomic regions could be either [GenomicRanges](https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/GenomicRanges_GRanges.html), [DNAStringSet](https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/Biostrings.html), 
[DNAString](https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/Biostrings.html), or character vector. You could see more detail with `?motifScan`

`motifscanR` could also be used for genomic regions motif enrichment analysis
 between two sets of genomic regions with `motifEnrichment` function. 

```r
# Get a motif pwms
example_motifs <- getJasparMotifs(species = "Homo sapiens",
                                  collection = "CORE")
# Make a set of input regions
Input <- GenomicRanges::GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1","chr2","chr2"),
                                ranges = IRanges::IRanges(start = c(76585873,42772928,100183786),
                                                          width = 500))
# Make a set of control regions
Control <- GenomicRanges::GRanges(seqnames = c("chr1","chr3","chr5"),
                                  ranges = IRanges::IRanges(start = c(453123,6524593,100184233),
                                                            width = 500))
# Scan motif for example motifs
motif_ix_input <- motifScan(example_motifs, Input, genome = "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
motif_ix_control <- motifScan(example_motifs, Control, genome = "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")

# Find Enrichment motif of input by control
Enrichment_result <- motifEnrichment(motif_ix_input, motif_ix_control)
```
You could type `?motifEnrichment` for more detail.
